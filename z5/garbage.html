    <h1>Garbage Collection in Java</h1>
    <p>
        Garbage Collection (GC) in Java is an automatic process used to reclaim memory by deleting objects 
        that are no longer in use. In Java, developers do not need to manually manage memory allocation 
        and deallocation; the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) handles memory management and garbage collection.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Garbage Collector (GC)</strong>: The GC is responsible for finding and deleting objects 
            that are no longer referenced, releasing their memory back to the heap.</li>
        <li><strong>Heap Memory</strong>: The heap is a region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation. 
            It contains objects created during runtime.</li>
        <li><strong>Reachable vs. Unreachable Objects</strong>: An object is "reachable" if it can be accessed 
            via a chain of references from active threads or static fields. If no such chain exists, the object 
            becomes "unreachable" and can be collected by the GC.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Garbage Collection Works</h2>
    <p>
        Java Garbage Collection works using the Mark and Sweep Algorithm. The process includes two phases:
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Mark:</strong> The GC identifies all live objects (reachable objects) and marks them.</li>
            <li><strong>Sweep:</strong> The GC removes all unmarked objects (unreachable objects) and frees the memory.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Garbage Collectors</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Serial Garbage Collector</strong>: Used in single-threaded environments.</li>
        <li><strong>Parallel Garbage Collector</strong>: Uses multiple threads to speed up garbage collection.</li>
        <li><strong>Concurrent Mark-Sweep (CMS) Collector</strong>: Minimizes pause times by performing most of its work concurrently with the application threads.</li>
        <li><strong>G1 Garbage Collector</strong>: Used in large applications, with a goal of low pause times and high throughput.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Examples of Garbage Collection</h2>

    <h3>Example 1: Simple Example of Garbage Collection</h3>
    <pre>
public class GCExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee e1 = new Employee("John", 25);
        Employee e2 = new Employee("Jane", 28);

        // After the object reference is set to null, the object becomes eligible for garbage collection.
        e1 = null;

        System.gc(); // Requesting garbage collection manually (not recommended for real-world use)
    }
}

class Employee {
    String name;
    int age;

    Employee(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        System.out.println("Garbage collected for " + name);
        super.finalize();
    }
}
    </pre>
    <p>
        In this example, the object <strong>e1</strong> becomes eligible for garbage collection when it is set to <strong>null</strong>. The 
        <strong>finalize()</strong> method is called when the object is garbage collected, printing a message indicating that the 
        object has been cleaned up.
    </p>

    <h3>Example 2: Demonstrating Unreachable Objects</h3>
    <pre>
public class UnreachableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = new String("Hello");
        str = null; // Now str is unreachable

        // Requesting garbage collection
        System.gc(); 
    }
}
    </pre>
    <p>
        When the reference <strong>str</strong> is set to <strong>null</strong>, the object it refers to becomes unreachable. The object becomes 
        eligible for garbage collection.
    </p>

    <h3>Example 3: Object Creation and GC Notification</h3>
    <pre>
public class ObjectGC {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee e1 = new Employee("Mike", 30);
        Employee e2 = new Employee("Sara", 22);

        // Employee e1 is no longer needed
        e1 = null;

        System.gc(); // Requesting garbage collection
    }
}
    </pre>
    <p>
        After setting <strong>e1</strong> to <strong>null</strong>, the object is eligible for garbage collection. The GC will clean it up when it runs.
    </p>

    <h3>Example 4: Automatically Called <code>finalize()</code></h3>
    <pre>
class Test {
    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        System.out.println("Object is being garbage collected.");
        super.finalize();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Test obj = new Test();
        obj = null;  // Making the object eligible for GC
        System.gc();  // Manually invoking GC
    }
}
    </pre>
    <p>
        The <strong>finalize()</strong> method is invoked when the object is garbage collected. This method allows you to define 
        cleanup actions before the object is collected.
    </p>

    <h3>Example 5: Garbage Collection with Multiple Objects</h3>
    <pre>
public class MultiObjectGC {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee e1 = new Employee("Alice", 30);
        Employee e2 = new Employee("Bob", 25);

        e1 = null;  // e1 object becomes unreachable
        e2 = null;  // e2 object becomes unreachable

        System.gc(); // Requesting garbage collection
    }
}
    </pre>
    <p>
        Both objects <strong>e1</strong> and <strong>e2</strong> are made unreachable, so they will be garbage collected when the GC runs.
    </p>

    <h3>Example 6: Preventing Garbage Collection with Strong Reference</h3>
    <pre>
public class PreventGC {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee e1 = new Employee("Jake", 35);

        // e1 has a strong reference, and the object will not be garbage collected
        System.gc();  // Garbage collection is requested, but the object will not be collected
    }
}
    </pre>
    <p>
        The object <strong>e1</strong> still has a strong reference, so it will not be garbage collected, even when GC is manually requested.
    </p>

    <h3>Example 7: Soft Reference Example</h3>
    <pre>
import java.lang.ref.SoftReference;

public class SoftReferenceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee e1 = new Employee("Luke", 28);

        // Soft reference to the object
        SoftReference<Employee> softRef = new SoftReference<>(e1);

        // The object can be garbage collected when memory is low
        e1 = null;

        // Suggest garbage collection
        System.gc();
    }
}
    </pre>
    <p>
        A soft reference holds a reference to the object. The object can be collected when the JVM is running out of memory.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        In Java, Garbage Collection is an automatic process that helps to manage memory by deleting objects that are 
        no longer reachable. Java provides different types of collectors, such as the Serial GC, Parallel GC, CMS GC, 
        and G1 GC. It is important to note that while we can request garbage collection, we cannot force it to happen 
        at any specific time, and it is not recommended to manually invoke GC in production code.
