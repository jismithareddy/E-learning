    <h1>What is Java?</h1>
    <p class="intro">Java is a high-level, object-oriented, and platform-independent programming language developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in 1995.</p>
    <p>Java follows the principle of "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA), which means Java programs can run on any device that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) without modification.</p>

    <h2>Key Features of Java</h2>
    <ul class="features">
        <li>Platform Independence: Java code is compiled into bytecode that can be executed on any platform with a JVM.</li>
        <li>Object-Oriented: Java promotes code reuse and modularity through classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.</li>
        <li>Automatic Memory Management: Java has built-in garbage collection to handle memory management, reducing the burden on developers.</li>
        <li>Multithreading: Java supports multithreading for efficient, concurrent execution of tasks.</li>
        <li>Security: Java provides security mechanisms such as the sandbox model and bytecode verification.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>History of Java</h2>
    <p class="history">Java was initially developed as a small project called Oak in 1991 by Sun Microsystems. It was later renamed to Java in 1995. Java quickly became popular due to its portability and ease of use in web-based applications. In 2009, Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle Corporation, which now maintains Java.</p>

    <h2>Why Use Java?</h2>
    <p>Java is used for a wide range of applications, including:</p>
    <ul class="features">
        <li>Web Development: Java is used for creating dynamic web applications using technologies like JSP, Servlets, and frameworks like Spring.</li>
        <li>Mobile Development: Java is the main language for building Android apps.</li>
        <li>Enterprise Applications: Java is widely used in large-scale enterprise-level applications for financial systems, CRM systems, and more.</li>
        <li>Big Data: Java is also used in big data frameworks like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Java Ecosystem</h2>
    <p>The Java ecosystem includes a variety of tools and platforms to build different kinds of applications:</p>
    <ul class="ecosystem">
        <li>Java Standard Edition (Java SE): Provides core libraries and APIs for general-purpose applications.</li>
        <li>Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE): Used for building large-scale, distributed, multi-tier applications.</li>
        <li>Java Micro Edition (Java ME): Used for building applications on embedded devices and mobile platforms.</li>
        <li>JavaFX: For building rich client-side applications with graphical user interfaces.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Platforms for Writing and Running Java Code</h2>
    <p>There are several platforms and tools that developers can use to write, compile, and run Java code:</p>
    <ul class="platforms">
        <li><b>IDE (Integrated Development Environment):</b> IDEs provide a complete environment to code, compile, and run Java programs with advanced features such as debugging, code completion, and version control.</li>
        <li><b>IntelliJ IDEA:</b> A popular Java IDE known for its powerful features and user-friendly interface. It offers smart code completion and extensive support for Java frameworks.</li>
        <li><b>Eclipse:</b> Another widely-used IDE, Eclipse is open-source and highly customizable. It supports Java, along with many other languages, and has a vast library of plugins.</li>
        <li><b>NetBeans:</b> An open-source IDE that provides support for Java development, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.</li>
        <li><b>Command Line (Terminal):</b> You can also write, compile, and run Java programs using the Java Development Kit (JDK) from the terminal or command line interface. This is more basic but ideal for learning and practicing Java.</li>
        <li><b>Online Platforms:</b> Platforms like <a href="https://repl.it" target="_blank">Repl.it</a>, <a href="https://www.jdoodle.com/" target="_blank">JDoodle</a>, and <a href="https://ideone.com/" target="_blank">Ideone</a> allow you to write and run Java code directly in your browser without the need for any installations.</li>
    </ul>
