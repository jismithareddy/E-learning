            <h2>Introduction to Chess Notation</h2>
            <p>
                Chess notation is the standardized language used to record moves in chess. It allows players to document their games, analyze past games, and share strategies. Understanding chess notation is essential for anyone wanting to improve their chess skills, as it is used in books, tutorials, and competitive play.

            <h2>Algebraic Notation</h2>
            <p>
                The most widely used notation in chess is the algebraic notation. It uses letters and numbers to represent the squares on the board and abbreviations to identify the pieces. Each move is written down in a format that shows which piece moved and to which square.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Files and Ranks:</strong> The vertical columns of the board are called files and are labeled a through h. The horizontal rows are called ranks and are numbered 1 to 8.</li>
                <li><strong>Piece Abbreviations:</strong> Each piece has an abbreviation in notation: King (K), Queen (Q), Rook (R), Bishop (B), and Knight (N). Pawns are not given a letter and are indicated by their destination square.</li>
                <li><strong>Move Format:</strong> A move typically consists of the piece abbreviation and the destination square (e.g., "Nf3" for a knight moving to f3). If a pawn moves to d4, it’s written simply as "d4."</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Special Symbols and Moves</h2>
            <p>Chess notation includes symbols to describe unique moves and situations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Castling:</strong> Kingside castling is noted as "O-O," while queenside castling is "O-O-O."</li>
                <li><strong>Captures:</strong> When a piece captures another, an "x" is used. For example, if a knight captures a piece on e5, it is written "Nxe5."</li>
                <li><strong>Checks:</strong> A "+" is added at the end of a move to indicate a check, e.g., "Qd5+".</li>
                <li><strong>Checkmate:</strong> A "#" symbol signifies checkmate, e.g., "Qd8#."</li>
                <li><strong>Promotion:</strong> When a pawn reaches the last rank and promotes, the new piece is indicated, e.g., "e8=Q" for a pawn promoting to a queen.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Annotating Chess Games</h2>
            <p>Annotations provide additional insights into moves, helping players understand the quality of moves and strategies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Good Move:</strong> Noted with "!" (e.g., "Nf3!").</li>
                <li><strong>Excellent Move:</strong> Noted with "!!".</li>
                <li><strong>Questionable Move:</strong> Noted with "?" (e.g., "Nf3?").</li>
                <li><strong>Blunder:</strong> Noted with "??".</li>
                <li><strong>Interesting Move:</strong> Noted with "!?" indicating a creative move that might be risky.</li>
                <li><strong>Dubious Move:</strong> Noted with "?!" indicating a move that could lead to weaknesses.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Example of Recorded Game</h2>
            <p>
                Here’s an example of a chess game recorded in algebraic notation:
            </p>
            <p>
                1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 d6
            </p>
            <p>This notation shows a sequence of moves by both players, with each pair of moves recorded as a turn.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Descriptive Notation (Older Style)</h2>
            <p>
                Descriptive notation is an older form of recording moves, commonly used before algebraic notation became the standard. It describes moves based on piece type and starting square, but is less common today.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>File Names:</strong> Files are named based on the piece that starts on them. For example, "K" for the king’s file, "Q" for the queen’s file, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Move Format:</strong> Moves are recorded using file names and directions (e.g., "P-K4" for advancing the king’s pawn to the fourth rank).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Learning chess notation enhances your ability to study, analyze, and share chess games. Mastering this notation will allow you to follow professional games and improve your strategies by reviewing annotated games.</p>
