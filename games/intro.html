    <p>Chess is a two-player strategy board game that has been played for centuries. It is a game of skill and tactics, where players compete to checkmate their opponent's king while protecting their own. The game is played on an 8x8 grid known as the chessboard, featuring 64 squares of alternating colors.</p>

        <li><strong>Knight:</strong> Moves in an L-shape (two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular).</li>
        <li><strong>Pawn:</strong> Moves forward one square but captures diagonally.</li>
    </ul>
