    <h1>Python Tuples - Detailed Explanation</h1>
    <p>In Python, tuples are a built-in, immutable data structure that allows us to store multiple items (of any data type) in a single variable. A tuple is an ordered collection, meaning the order of elements is preserved. Unlike lists, tuples are immutable, meaning once they are created, their content cannot be changed.</p>

    <h2>Key Features of Tuples</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ordered:</strong> Tuples maintain the order of elements as they are added.</li>
        <li><strong>Immutable:</strong> Tuples cannot be changed once created. You cannot modify, add, or remove elements.</li>
        <li><strong>Indexed:</strong> Each element in a tuple is associated with an index, starting from 0.</li>
        <li><strong>Heterogeneous:</strong> A tuple can contain elements of different data types, such as integers, strings, booleans, floats, or even other tuples.</li>
        <li><strong>Hashable:</strong> Since tuples are immutable, they can be used as keys in dictionaries, unlike lists.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Creating Tuples</h2>
    <p>Tuples are created using parentheses <code>( )</code> and separating items with commas. The syntax for creating a tuple is:</p>
    <p><code>tuple_name = (item1, item2, item3, ...)</code></p>

    <h3>Example Code:</h3>
    <div class="example-code">
        <code>
        # Creating a tuple with integers
        my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
        print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

        # Creating a tuple with different data types
        mixed_tuple = (1, "apple", 3.14, True, (1, 2, 3))
        print(mixed_tuple)  # Output: (1, 'apple', 3.14, True, (1, 2, 3))
        </code>
    </div>

    <h2>Accessing Elements in a Tuple</h2>
    <p>Elements in a tuple can be accessed by their index. The index starts from 0 for the first element. You can access individual items, as well as sub-tuples (slicing).</p>

    <h3>Example Code:</h3>
    <div class="example-code">
        <code>
        my_tuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "date")

        # Accessing the first element
        print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: apple

        # Accessing the last element
        print(my_tuple[-1])  # Output: date

        # Slicing the tuple (getting a subset)
        print(my_tuple[1:3])  # Output: ('banana', 'cherry')
        </code>
    </div>

    <h2>Reverse Slicing</h2>
    <p>Reverse slicing allows you to extract elements from a tuple starting from the end, moving towards the beginning. You can achieve this by specifying a negative step value in the slicing operation.</p>
    <p>The general syntax for reverse slicing is:</p>
    <p><code>tuple[start:end:-step]</code></p>
    <p>Where:
        <ul>
            <li><code>start</code>: The index where the slice begins (inclusive).</li>
            <li><code>end</code>: The index where the slice ends (exclusive).</li>
            <li><code>step</code>: The step size, i.e., the number of elements to skip (negative for reverse order).</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Example Code:</h3>
    <div class="example-code">
        <code>
        my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

        # Reverse slicing from index 8 to 3 (in reverse order)
        reverse_slice = my_tuple[8:2:-1]
        print(reverse_slice)  # Output: (9, 8, 7, 6, 5)

        # Reverse slicing with step of 2
        step_reverse_slice = my_tuple[7:1:-2]
        print(step_reverse_slice)  # Output: (8, 6, 4, 2)
        </code>
    </div>

    <h2>Immutability of Tuples</h2>
    <p>Unlike lists, tuples are immutable. This means once a tuple is created, it cannot be altered. You cannot modify, add, or remove elements from a tuple. For example:</p>
    <h3>Example Code:</h3>
    <div class="example-code">
        <code>
        my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)

        # Trying to change an element (will raise an error)
        try:
            my_tuple[1] = 4
        except TypeError as e:
            print(e)  # Output: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
        </code>
    </div>

    <h2>Tuples and Nesting</h2>
    <p>Tuples can contain other tuples, and this can be useful for organizing data in a structured way. These are called nested tuples.</p>

    <h3>Example Code:</h3>
    <div class="example-code">
        <code>
        nested_tuple = (1, 2, (3, 4, 5), 6)
        print(nested_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, (3, 4, 5), 6)

        # Accessing elements in the nested tuple
        print(nested_tuple[2][1])  # Output: 4
        </code>
    </div>

    <h2>Tuple Operations</h2>
    <p>Tuples support a few operations, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Concatenation (+):</strong> Combine two or more tuples using the plus operator.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition (*):</strong> Repeat a tuple using the multiplication operator.</li>
        <li><strong>Membership (in, not in):</strong> Check if an element exists within a tuple.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example Code:</h3>
    <div class="example-code">
        <code>
        tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
        tuple2 = (4, 5, 6)

        # Concatenating two tuples
        combined_tuple = tuple1 + tuple2
        print(combined_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

        # Repeating a tuple
        repeated_tuple = tuple1 * 2
        print(repeated_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)

        # Membership test
        print(4 in tuple2)  # Output: True
        print(7 not in tuple2)  # Output: True
        </code>
    </div>

    <h2>Tuple Packing and Unpacking</h2>
    <p>Tuples are often used for packing and unpacking values. Packing is when multiple values are assigned to a tuple, while unpacking is the process of extracting values from a tuple.</p>

    <h3>Example Code:</h3>
    <div class="example-code">
        <code>
        # Packing a tuple
        packed_tuple = 1, 2, 3

        # Unpacking a tuple
        a, b, c = packed_tuple
        print(a, b, c)  # Output: 1 2 3
        </code>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Tuples are a lightweight and efficient data structure in Python. Due to their immutability, they provide better performance and safety for certain operations, making them ideal for storing fixed collections of data. Mastering tuple operations like slicing, packing, and unpacking allows you to use tuples effectively in a wide range of applications.</p>
