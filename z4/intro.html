        <h1>Introduction to Python</h1>
        <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has gained immense popularity in recent years due to its wide range of applications and ease of use.</p>
        
        <h2>History of Python</h2>
        <p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s and implemented by Guido van Rossum in December 1989. Its official release, Python 0.9.0, was in February 1991. Pythonâ€™s design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than other languages.</p>
        <p>Python 2.0 was released in 2000, introducing many new features, including list comprehensions and garbage collection. In 2008, Python 3.0 was introduced with improvements in language design, but it was not backward-compatible with Python 2.x. Today, Python 3.x is the present and future of the language, with Python 2.x officially reaching its end-of-life in 2020.</p>

        <h2>Platforms Where Python is Used</h2>
        <p>Python is a cross-platform language, meaning it can run on multiple operating systems. Some platforms where Python is widely used include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> Frameworks like Django, Flask, and Pyramid help build robust websites and web applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Science and Machine Learning:</strong> Python is a go-to language for data scientists, with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and TensorFlow.</li>
            <li><strong>Automation and Scripting:</strong> Python is frequently used for automating tasks, writing scripts, and process automation.</li>
            <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning:</strong> Python has become the standard for AI, with tools such as Keras and PyTorch.</li>
            <li><strong>Software Development:</strong> Python supports rapid application development and is used in desktop GUI applications, APIs, and more.</li>
            <li><strong>Game Development:</strong> Python is used for game prototyping and even in full-fledged games with engines like Pygame.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Python?</h2>
        <p>Python's popularity is attributed to several reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Easy to Learn:</strong> Python's simple syntax mimics natural language, making it easy to learn and write.</li>
            <li><strong>Versatile:</strong> Python can be used for web development, data analysis, AI, scientific computing, and more.</li>
            <li><strong>Large Community:</strong> Python has an active, growing community, which means plenty of support, tutorials, and resources are available.</li>
            <li><strong>Rich Libraries:</strong> Python comes with an extensive standard library, and there are numerous third-party libraries for specialized tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-Platform:</strong> Python runs on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, without modification.</li>
            <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> Python is open-source and free to use, which promotes its widespread adoption in industries and education.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Features of Python</h2>
        <p>Python has several distinctive features that make it a powerful programming language:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Simple and Readable Syntax:</strong> Python emphasizes readability, allowing developers to write clean and understandable code.</li>
            <li><strong>Interpreted Language:</strong> Python does not need to be compiled before execution. The interpreter runs the code line by line, which helps in debugging.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamically Typed:</strong> Python allows variables to change types during runtime, giving flexibility but also enforcing careful usage.</li>
            <li><strong>Object-Oriented:</strong> Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.</li>
            <li><strong>Extensive Library Support:</strong> Python has a wide range of libraries and frameworks that support different tasks like web development, data manipulation, and more.</li>
            <li><strong>Portable:</strong> Python code can run on any machine that has the Python interpreter installed, making it highly portable.</li>
            <li><strong>Extensible and Embeddable:</strong> Python can be extended by writing C/C++ code and can be embedded into other applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Automated Memory Management:</strong> Python handles memory management on its own using a built-in garbage collector.</li>
        </ul>
