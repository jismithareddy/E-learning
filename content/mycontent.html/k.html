            <h6>What is Programming?</h6>
            <p>Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a specific task. These instructions, known as <strong>code</strong>, are written in various programming languages, such as Python, Java, C, and JavaScript, which the computer can interpret and execute.</p>
            <p>Programming is fundamental to the operation of modern technology. It allows for the creation of software, websites, mobile apps, games, and more. From the simplest calculator app on your phone to complex systems like autopilot on airplanes, programming powers almost everything we use daily.</p>

            <h2>Key Concepts of Programming</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> High-level languages like Python and Java are easier to write and use for most applications, while low-level languages offer more control over hardware.</li>
                <li><strong>Code:</strong> Code consists of instructions that a computer follows. It must adhere to specific syntax rules depending on the programming language.</li>
                <li><strong>Compilers & Interpreters:</strong> A compiler translates code into machine code, while an interpreter executes code line by line.</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithms:</strong> Step-by-step procedures used to solve problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Structures:</strong> Efficient ways to organize and store data, such as arrays, lists, trees, and maps.</li>
                <li><strong>Control Structures:</strong> Statements like "if" and loops that control the flow of a program.</li>
                <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong> A paradigm that structures programs around objects and includes concepts like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Real-World Applications of Programming</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> Building and managing websites using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
                <li><strong>Mobile App Development:</strong> Creating applications for smartphones using languages like Swift (iOS) or Kotlin (Android).</li>
                <li><strong>Game Development:</strong> Using tools like Unity and Unreal Engine to create games for various platforms.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Science & AI:</strong> Languages like Python and R are widely used to analyze data, build AI models, and automate tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Embedded Systems:</strong> Programming small devices like smart home gadgets, automotive electronics, and medical equipment.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Importance of Programming</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Programming allows repetitive tasks to be automated, saving time and reducing human error.</li>
                <li><strong>Problem Solving:</strong> Helps break down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Creativity:</strong> Programming allows you to create anything from mobile apps to software that solves real-world problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Career Opportunities:</strong> Learning programming opens many career paths, including software development, data science, game development, and more.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Getting Started with Programming</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Choose a Language:</strong> For beginners, languages like Python or JavaScript are recommended due to their readability and widespread use.</li>
                <li><strong>Write Simple Code:</strong> Start small, with projects like a calculator or a to-do list app to learn the basics.</li>
                <li><strong>Practice Problem Solving:</strong> Use platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank to practice solving algorithmic problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Learn through Projects:</strong> Build real-world projects to apply what you've learned, such as creating a personal blog or a simple web app.</li>
