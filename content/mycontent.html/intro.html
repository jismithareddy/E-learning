            <h6>What is Programming?</h6>
            <p>Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a specific task. These instructions, known as <strong>code</strong>, are written in various programming languages, such as Python, Java, C, and JavaScript, which the computer can interpret and execute.</p>
            <p>Programming is fundamental to the operation of modern technology. It allows for the creation of software, websites, mobile apps, games, and more. From the simplest calculator app on your phone to complex systems like autopilot on airplanes, programming powers almost everything we use daily.</p>
