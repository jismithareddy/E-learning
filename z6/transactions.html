<h2>Transactions in SQL</h2>
<p>
    A <strong>transaction</strong> in SQL is a sequence of one or more SQL statements that are executed as a single logical unit of work. 
    Transactions are essential for ensuring data integrity and consistency, especially in multi-user environments where concurrent access to the database can occur.
</p>

<h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
<p>Transactions are governed by the <strong>ACID</strong> properties:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Atomicity:</strong> This property ensures that a transaction is treated as a single unit. 
        If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is aborted, and the database is rolled back to its state before the transaction began.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Consistency:</strong> A transaction must transition the database from one valid state to another. 
        Any transaction must ensure that the integrity constraints are maintained.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Isolation:</strong> Transactions must operate independently. 
        The operations of a transaction should not be visible to other transactions until the transaction is committed.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Durability:</strong> Once a transaction is committed, its changes become permanent, even in the event of a system failure.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Transaction Control Protocols</h2>
<p>Transaction control commands in SQL are used to manage the execution of transactions. Here are the primary commands:</p>

<h3>1. BEGIN TRANSACTION</h3>
<p>This command marks the start of a transaction. All subsequent SQL statements are part of this transaction until a COMMIT or ROLLBACK is executed.</p>
<code>BEGIN TRANSACTION;</code>

<h3>2. COMMIT</h3>
<p>This command is used to save all the changes made during the transaction. Once committed, the changes cannot be rolled back.</p>
<code>COMMIT;</code>

<h3>3. ROLLBACK</h3>
<p>This command is used to undo all changes made during the transaction. If an error occurs, this command can restore the database to its previous state.</p>
<code>ROLLBACK;</code>

<h3>4. SAVEPOINT</h3>
<p>This command is used to set a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back. This is useful for larger transactions where you may want to undo part of the transaction without affecting the entire transaction.</p>
<code>SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;</code>

<h2>Transaction Example</h2>
<p>Consider a bank transfer operation where money is transferred from Account A to Account B:</p>
<pre>
<code>
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance - 100
WHERE account_id = 'A';  -- Debiting Account A

UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance + 100
WHERE account_id = 'B';  -- Crediting Account B

COMMIT;  -- Commit the transaction if both operations are successful
</code>
</pre>

<h2>What are Locks?</h2>
<p>Locks are mechanisms used to manage concurrent access to the database. They prevent multiple transactions from interfering with each other, ensuring data integrity and consistency.</p>

<h2>Types of Locks</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Shared Lock:</strong> Allows multiple transactions to read a resource but prevents any transaction from modifying it.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Exclusive Lock:</strong> Allows a transaction to both read and modify a resource, preventing other transactions from accessing it.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Update Lock:</strong> Used to prevent a deadlock by signaling that a transaction intends to modify a resource.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Intent Lock:</strong> A higher-level lock that indicates a transaction intends to acquire a lock on a lower-level resource.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Deadlocks</h2>
<p>A deadlock occurs when two or more transactions are waiting for each other to release locks, creating a cycle of dependencies that prevents any transaction from proceeding. For example:</p>
<pre>
<code>
Transaction 1:          Transaction 2:
------------------      ------------------
1. LOCK A               1. LOCK B
2. LOCK B (wait)       2. LOCK A (wait)
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Lock-Based Protocols</h2>
<p>Lock-based protocols are strategies for managing locks and ensuring serializability of transactions. Two common lock-based protocols are:</p>

<h3>1. Strict Two-Phase Locking (S2PL)</h3>
<p>In Strict Two-Phase Locking, a transaction must hold all its locks until it completes (commits or rolls back). This ensures that no other transaction can access locked resources, thus guaranteeing serializability.</p>
<h4>Advantages:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Guaranteed serializability</li>
    <li>Simple implementation</li>
</ul>
<h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Higher chances of deadlocks</li>
    <li>Increased waiting time for transactions</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Two-Phase Locking (2PL)</h3>
<p>In Two-Phase Locking, a transaction goes through two phases:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Growing Phase:</strong> The transaction can acquire locks but cannot release any.</li>
    <li><strong>Shrinking Phase:</strong> The transaction can release locks but cannot acquire any more.</li>
</ul>
<p>This flexibility can reduce waiting times but might lead to non-serializable schedules.</p>
<h4>Advantages:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Flexibility in lock management</li>
    <li>Lower chances of deadlocks compared to S2PL</li>
</ul>
<h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Potential for non-serializable schedules</li>
    <li>Complex implementation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Understanding transactions, locks, and lock-based protocols is essential for maintaining data integrity and consistency in SQL databases. 
By effectively managing transactions and locking mechanisms, you can ensure that your database operates efficiently and reliably.</p>
