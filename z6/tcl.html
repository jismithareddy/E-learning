    <h1>Transaction Control Language (TCL) in SQL</h1>

    <p>Transaction Control Language (TCL) commands in SQL are used to manage the transactions in a database. Transactions are sequences of SQL statements that are treated as a single unit of work. TCL commands allow you to control whether the changes made in the transaction should be saved or rolled back.</p>

    <h2>What is a Transaction?</h2>
    <p>A transaction is a logical unit of work that must be completed entirely; otherwise, the changes made in the transaction are discarded. A transaction has four main properties, often referred to as **ACID** properties:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Atomicity:</strong> Ensures that all operations within the transaction are completed successfully; otherwise, the transaction is aborted.</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Ensures that the database properly changes state upon a successfully committed transaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Ensures that transactions are securely and independently processed at the same time without interference.</li>
        <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Ensures that the result or effect of a committed transaction persists even after a system failure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>TCL Commands</h2>
    <p>TCL provides four main commands that allow the management of transactions:</p>
    
    <h3>1. COMMIT</h3>
    <p>The <strong>COMMIT</strong> command is used to permanently save the changes made during the current transaction. Once a transaction is committed, it cannot be undone.</p>

    <h3>2. ROLLBACK</h3>
    <p>The <strong>ROLLBACK</strong> command is used to undo the changes made during the current transaction. If any part of the transaction fails or an error occurs, the entire transaction can be rolled back to the original state.</p>

    <h3>3. SAVEPOINT</h3>
    <p>The <strong>SAVEPOINT</strong> command is used to set a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back. Multiple savepoints can be set within a transaction.</p>

    <h3>4. RELEASE SAVEPOINT</h3>
    <p>The <strong>RELEASE SAVEPOINT</strong> command is used to delete a previously defined savepoint. It can no longer be rolled back to after being released.</p>

    <h3>5. SET TRANSACTION</h3>
    <p>The <strong>SET TRANSACTION</strong> command is used to set the characteristics of the current transaction, such as its isolation level.</p>

    <h2>Examples of TCL Commands</h2>

    <h3>Example 1: COMMIT</h3>
    <p>The following example demonstrates the use of the <code>COMMIT</code> command:</p>
    <div class="code-description">
        <pre>
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO orders (order_id, customer_id, amount)
VALUES (1, 101, 500);

-- Commit the changes
COMMIT;
        </pre>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> The <code>COMMIT</code> command saves the newly inserted order into the <code>orders</code> table. Once committed, the change is permanent and cannot be rolled back.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Example 2: ROLLBACK</h3>
    <p>The following example shows the use of the <code>ROLLBACK</code> command:</p>
    <div class="code-description">
        <pre>
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary + 2000
WHERE employee_id = 105;

-- An error occurs, roll back the changes
ROLLBACK;
        </pre>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> The salary update is rolled back, and the <code>employees</code> table remains unchanged due to the <code>ROLLBACK</code> command.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Example 3: SAVEPOINT and ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT</h3>
    <p>The following example demonstrates the use of <code>SAVEPOINT</code> and <code>ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT</code>:</p>
    <div class="code-description">
        <pre>
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO products (product_id, product_name, price)
VALUES (101, 'Laptop', 700);

SAVEPOINT save1;  -- Create a savepoint

INSERT INTO products (product_id, product_name, price)
VALUES (102, 'Tablet', 400);

-- Rollback to the savepoint
ROLLBACK TO save1;

-- Commit the transaction
COMMIT;
        </pre>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> After inserting the laptop, a savepoint is created. When inserting the tablet, we decide to roll back to the <code>save1</code> savepoint, effectively undoing the tablet insertion while keeping the laptop insertion intact.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Example 4: SET TRANSACTION</h3>
    <p>The following example shows how to set the isolation level of a transaction using <code>SET TRANSACTION</code>:</p>
    <div class="code-description">
        <pre>
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;

BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Transaction operations

COMMIT;
        </pre>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> The transaction is set to the highest isolation level, <code>SERIALIZABLE</code>, to ensure that no other transaction can interfere with this transactionâ€™s execution.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Comprehensive Example Using All TCL Commands</h2>
    <h3>Example 5: Complete Transaction Flow</h3>
    <p>This example shows a complex transaction where we use all the TCL commands:</p>
    <div class="code-description">
        <pre>
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Step 1: Insert a new customer
INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, name, email)
VALUES (201, 'John Doe', 'john@example.com');

-- Step 2: Create a savepoint after the first insert
SAVEPOINT save1;

-- Step 3: Insert an order for the customer
INSERT INTO orders (order_id, customer_id, amount)
VALUES (301, 201, 800);

-- Step 4: Create another savepoint
SAVEPOINT save2;

-- Step 5: Try to insert a faulty product
INSERT INTO products (product_id, product_name, price)
VALUES (NULL, 'Smartphone', 600);  -- This will fail due to NULL product_id

-- Step 6: Rollback to the second savepoint to undo the faulty product insertion
ROLLBACK TO save2;

-- Step 7: Commit the transaction
COMMIT;
        </pre>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> A new customer is inserted into the <code>customers</code> table.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> A savepoint <code>save1</code> is created after inserting the customer.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> An order is placed for the customer in the <code>orders</code> table.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Another savepoint <code>save2</code> is created after inserting the order.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> An attempt is made to insert a product, but this fails because the <code>product_id</code> cannot be NULL.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> The transaction is rolled back to <code>save2</code>, undoing the faulty product insertion but keeping the order.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 7:</strong> The transaction is committed, saving the changes made before <code>save2</code>, i.e., the customer and the order.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
