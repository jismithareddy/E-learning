    <h1>Introduction to JavaScript</h1>

    <div class="code-description">
        <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
        <pre><code>// JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language
// that is widely used for both client-side and server-side development.
// It allows you to create interactive and dynamic web pages.

console.log("Hello, World!");</code></pre>
        <p class="description">JavaScript is a powerful programming language that enables web developers to build interactive and dynamic features like animations, form validation, and content updates without needing to reload the page. It is a core technology alongside HTML and CSS in web development.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="code-description">
        <h2>History of JavaScript</h2>
        <pre><code>/* JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was 
working at Netscape Communications Corporation. Initially, it was developed 
as a scripting language for the Netscape Navigator web browser. */

// Milestones in JavaScript's history:
// - 1995: JavaScript was created and released as Mocha.
// - 1996: Officially renamed JavaScript.
// - 1997: Standardized as ECMAScript (ES1).
// - 2009: ECMAScript 5 introduced new features like strict mode.
// - 2015: ECMAScript 6 (ES6) brought major improvements like arrow functions, 
//         classes, and modules.</code></pre>
        <p class="description">JavaScript was created in just 10 days in 1995 by Brendan Eich while working for Netscape. Since then, it has become the most popular programming language for building web applications. ECMAScript is the standardized version of JavaScript, with ES6 (2015) being a pivotal release that modernized the language.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="code-description">
        <h2>Why JavaScript?</h2>
        <pre><code>/* JavaScript has become essential for modern web development
for several reasons:

1. Ubiquity: Every major web browser supports JavaScript.
2. Versatility: Can be used on both the front-end and back-end.
3. Rich Ecosystem: Thousands of libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, and Node.js.
4. Performance: Runs directly in the browser, providing fast interaction.
5. Asynchronous programming: Supports async operations with promises, async/await, etc. */

// Example: Displaying a dynamic greeting based on time
const greeting = (hour) => {
    if (hour < 12) {
        return "Good morning!";
    } else if (hour < 18) {
        return "Good afternoon!";
    } else {
        return "Good evening!";
    }
};
console.log(greeting(new Date().getHours()));</code></pre>
        <p class="description">JavaScript is highly versatile and can be used for both front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) development. It enables the creation of rich, interactive user interfaces and performs asynchronously, making it crucial for fast, dynamic web experiences.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="code-description">
        <h2>Platforms where JavaScript is used</h2>
        <pre><code>/* JavaScript runs on a wide variety of platforms, including:

1. Web Browsers: JavaScript is natively supported by all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
2. Server-side: Using platforms like Node.js, JavaScript can power back-end logic.
3. Mobile Development: With frameworks like React Native, JavaScript can be used to develop mobile apps.
4. Desktop Applications: Platforms like Electron allow developers to build cross-platform desktop apps.
5. Game Development: JavaScript is used in game development using libraries like Phaser.js. */

// Example: Using Node.js for a simple server
const http = require('http');
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.statusCode = 200;
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
    res.end('Hello from Node.js server!');
});
server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running at http://localhost:3000/');
});</code></pre>
        <p class="description">JavaScript's reach extends beyond just web browsers. With Node.js, it can handle server-side applications. It also powers mobile apps, desktop apps (through Electron), and even game development. This makes JavaScript an incredibly versatile tool in the hands of developers.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a key technology that drives the web and powers a wide range of applications. Its ability to work across platforms makes it an indispensable part of modern development.</p>
